				  <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Lexis Hibiscus Port Dickinson is one of the most iconic luxury hotels in the region. Its villas are built over the water forming the shape of a hibiscus flower stretching almost a mile into the Strait of Malacca, and suites are housed in a big tower overlooking the beach. All rooms have top-notch features such as private plunge pools and steam rooms, and the vast majority of them offer great sea views. This is a solid option for those seeking a fun-filled family vacation, with water sports, Segways, and even helicopter rides but expect to pay extra fees for everything, including the kids’ club. A dozen restaurants offer varied (but rather average) food, from causal buffets and outdoor barbecue joints to more formal a la carte eateries. </p>
				   <p style="font-size: 15px;">The hotel has 639 rooms, including two-bedroom suites located in the main tower and a number of villas housed in small buildings built directly on the water. Decor is contemporary, if a tad generic, consisting of off-white tile floors, minimalist furniture in earth tones, and pops of purple, blue, orange, and pink that may be cheerful or loud depending on taste. All rooms are spacious and airy, with at least two king beds and floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto terraces with private plunge pools and loungers. Bathrooms are large and attractive, with double sinks, windows to the terrace, walk-in rainfall showers, and separate soaking tubs with sea views. All rooms have steam rooms as well. </p>
				    <p>Aside from the plunge pools and steam baths, room amenities are average for a luxury hotel. Flat-screen TVs are large, but some guests have complained that the signal can be spotty, and there are electric kettles and mini-fridges with some water and sodas instead of espresso machines and fully stocked minibars. Wi-Fi is free throughout the property. Some suites have kitchens, and Presidential Suites are duplex units located at the far end of the property, complete with two infinity pools and four bedrooms.</p>

				  <p style="font-size: 15px;">The Port Dickson Ostrich Show Farm is a fun and popular attraction in Port Dickson, especially for families. Ostriches are the main attraction but there is far more to see and do at this Ostrich Show Farm Port Dickson than look at ostriches.As you would expect, ostriches are the main attraction. You can talk to them, pet them, feed them and even take a ride on one. Rides, however, are only for kids under 40 kilograms.We had been hesitant about the rides but they do seem quite safe with two staff guiding the ostrich and making sure our kids were safe. The ostriches can be big – they grow up to three metres tall and 150 kilograms!You can also stand on an ostrich egg! They are surprising strong. When you have finished meeting the ostriches, there are many other animals to see, pet and feed. These include rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens, goats, peacocks, turkeys, donkeys, snakes, camels, horses, hedgehogs and fish. </p>

				  <p style="font-size: 15px;">Kelip-kelip sungai timun are the largest habitat in Malaysia. The beauty is even more pronounced if visitors come at dusk. They can rent a fishing boat at the Pengkalan Nelayan Jetty in Kampung Sungai Timun to be taken along the river for three to five kilometers.Despite the long existence of fireflies in the area, many are unaware of the potential that can be explored as a new attraction to the tourism industry.There are four species of kelip-kelip in sungai timun where the unique little animal is said to breed so abundantly from July to October each year. The largest species of kelip-kelip is Panthera Tigris Jacksoni. Tens of thousands of kelip-kelip adorn the trees along the river as if there was a party of glittering lights there during that period.</p>
