				  <p style="font-size: 15px;">Aquaria KLCC, located on the concourse level of the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, is said to be one of the largest aquariums in Southeast Asia. Home to over 150 species of marine life, its star attractions include scary tiger sharks, lethal sea snakes, blue rays, bright coral fish, seahorses and more.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 15px;"> It’s a well-stocked aquarium just begging to be explored, and after a few hours here you'll have seen over 5,000 freshwater and marine creatures, including massive arapaimas, giant groupers, gar fish and more. Some people write it off as a tourist trap, but they’re sorely missing out – beyond the big tanks, with gallons of water, filled with necklaces of kelp, coral and mysterious and sometimes menacing sea creatures, is one of the country’s foremost sightseeing attractions with real depth and complexity.Well worth exploring, Kuala Lumpur Aquarium doesn’t just ‘submerge’ visitors beneath thousands of gallons of seawater – instead the venue is laid out to take visitors through different watery landscapes, from the highlands and flooded jungles of Malaysia, to the Amazon basin, coral reefs and the open ocean. Your journey isn’t a linear one – start off on Level 1 where you’ll see piranhas make quick work of their meal as well as electric eels, elephantnose fish and electric catfish. Also in this section, visitors can check out the DNA Touch Pool where they can pick up and feel the texture of live corals and star fish</p>
                   <p style="font-size: 15px;">One of the highlights of Aquaria KLCC is a giant tank (featuring an authentic-looking shipwreck) – a 90m walk-through tunnel with a moving travelator in its centre. Inside you’ll be surrounded by sand tiger sharks, huge stingrays and more. You can take a break from looking at Nemo and his crew, as you head to The Stream which plays host to the giant water rat and the adorable Asian small-clawed otter. Meanwhile, the Jewels of the Jungle section is home to a variety of reptiles, amphibians and insects including the green snake, coatimundi, tarantula and many others; also be sure to check out the exhibit showcasing the life cycle of butterflies.</p>
