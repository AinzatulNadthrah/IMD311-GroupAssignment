				  <p style="font-size: 15px;">A Famosa is the name of a tower built by the Portuguese after conquering Melaka in 1511. A Famosa part of Kota Melaka ( Fortaleza de Malaca ) which took 5 months to build. As a result of the scorching heat and lack of food, many forced laborers died while building the city. Materials to build the city were taken from the ruins of mosques and other buildings. The construction of the city of A Famosa under the direction of Alfonso de Albuquerque can be said to be a symbol of the resistance of the people of Melaka at that time, forcing the Portuguese to build a defensive city once they took control of the city of Melaka. </p>

The construction cost is around RM 24 million. The tower was officially opened on April 18, 2008 . The design is based on the design of Keris Taming Sari. It can accommodate up to 66 people at a time and is open from 10 am to 10 pm with a ticket price of RM20 for adults, RM10 for children and RM17 for senior citizens. Interestingly , Mykad owners have the opportunity to get a discount of up to 50 % when using this service.

The original location of this tower is on the banks of the Melaka River (near the Stadthuys Building ) but was moved to a new site because the original site has the ruins of the old wall of the Malay Sultanate of Melaka in addition to preserving the archaeological geofact. There is also a cafe called Taming Sari Cafe and a gift shop.</p>
