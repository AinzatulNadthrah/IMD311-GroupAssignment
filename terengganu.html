You will also see some caves on the face of the cliff where bats inhabit. Once you’re at the peak, you’ll be mesmerized by a panoramic view of the sea with Pulau Rhu and Pulau Perhentian in the distance. Although the vista is very often photographed, who knows you may capture something more spectacular with the changing sky light and weather.
